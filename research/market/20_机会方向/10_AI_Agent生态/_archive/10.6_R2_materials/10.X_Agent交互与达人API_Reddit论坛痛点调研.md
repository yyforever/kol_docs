## 十、调研局限性

1. **Reddit搜索结果有限**: 特定关键词组合（如"influencer API pain"）在Reddit上讨论较少，可能因为：
   - 专业讨论更多发生在Slack/Discord等封闭社区
   - 用户使用不同术语（"creator tools", "marketing platform"等）
   - 话题较新，尚未形成大规模讨论

2. **Hacker News访问限制**: 无法直接抓取评论区具体用户引用，只能通过搜索摘要获取主要观点

3. **时间范围**: 聚焦2025-2026年，但很多痛点可能存在更长时间

4. **语言局限**: 仅搜索英文内容，未覆盖中文社区讨论

## 结论

本次调研发现AI Agent生态和达人营销API领域存在严重的安全、质量和互操作性问题。虽然MCP协议已取得主导地位，但生态系统仍处于混乱状态，缺乏有效治理。达人营销API面临定价、数据质量和集成复杂性三大核心挑战。

**最具商业价值的痛点**:
1. MCP服务器质量与安全审查（16,000+服务器无管控）
2. 达人数据真实性验证（25%达人买粉）
3. Agent间标准化通信（协议碎片化）
4. Agentic Commerce基础设施适配（遗留系统改造）

这些痛点为创业公司和产品创新提供了明确方向。
